            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>My name is Heshan Dharmasiri, and I'm a Computer Science student with a strong focus on web development. I have a deep passion for creating dynamic and interactive web applications that solve real-world problems. My journey started with a curiosity about how things work, which naturally led me to coding and technology.</p>
            <p>In addition to web development, I have a keen interest in artificial intelligence and network security. Iâ€™m constantly seeking out new challenges to grow and expand my knowledge in these areas. My goal is to build innovative solutions that make a difference, whether through better user experiences or by enhancing security in the digital world.</p>
            <p>When I'm not coding, I enjoy playing chess  and learning about emerging technologies. I believe that continuous learning is key to staying ahead in the fast-paced world of technology. </a> section.</p>
